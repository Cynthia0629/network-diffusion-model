# network-diffusion-model
Linear network diffusion model for functional connectivity from fMRI data. The model is informed by the Laplacian of the underlying structural network from dMRI. This project was begun while working under Rachid Deriche at the Inria Sophia Antipolis-Méditerranée Research Centre from May-July 2018.

The original model is from Abdelnour et al (2014), "Network Diffusion Accurately Models the Relationship Between the Structural and Functional Brain".
